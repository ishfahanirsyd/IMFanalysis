# Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) Analysis

This repository contains a Python implementation to analyze the Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) as described by Chabrier (2005). The project includes tasks such as deriving the IMF, discretizing it on a logarithmically-scaled grid, and performing various calculations related to stellar masses.

## Project Overview

The project is structured around the following tasks:

### 1. Derivation of dN/dM:

Starting with the provided IMF equation, the form for $dN/dM$ is derived and defined as $\text{IMF}(M) = \frac{dN}{dM}$, where $M$ is in units of $M_{\odot}$.

### 2. Discretization on a Logarithmically-Scaled Grid:

The IMF is discretized on a grid of mass $M$ that is logarithmically scaled, ranging from $M_{\text{min}} = 10^{-2}$ to $M_{\text{max}} = 10^{2}$. The number of bins (sampling points) is a parameter in the script, allowing for flexibility in testing different resolutions.

### 3. Log-Log Plot of Discretized Function:

The discretized IMF function is plotted on a log-log scale, with appropriately labeled axes.

### 4. Calculation of the Mode Mass:

The mode (most probable mass) of the IMF is computed.

### 5. Average Mass Calculation:

The average mass of stars is computed by numerically integrating the IMF over the bins. A staggered binning approach is used, where the average in each bin is approximated as the arithmetic mean of the $M$ and IMF values at the bin edges. The IMF is normalized to ensure the integral forms a Probability Density Function (PDF).

### 6. Dependence on Number of Bins:

The script tests how the computed average star mass depends on the number of bins. A plot is generated to show the average $M$ as a function of the number of bins, and the number of bins required to converge on the average mass to within 1% accuracy is determined.

### 7. Average Mass for $M_{\text{max}} \rightarrow \infty$:

The average mass is computed for $M_{\text{max}} \rightarrow \infty$. This limit is approximated numerically by selecting a sufficiently large $M_{\text{max}}$ to ensure the mean mass converges to at least two significant figures.
